# ReadME-Generator

## Description

This project allows the user to create a README straight from the node js module. This helped me learn the following concepts:

- Working with the NodeJS module and interface
- Importing and working with tools such as inquirer and markdown generation 
- Familiarizing myself more with generated objects and referencing them with template literals
- Importing badges from shield and customizing them

## Installation

This is a command line interface and thus does not require installation

## Usage

The output ReadME can be found in Develop > output > readme.md

The video walkthrough of the generator can be found here:
